## Mapping with bwa, continued

Step 1: index reference genome with bwa index
Ran:
`ln -s /home/natassja/scratch/Bio722/term_project/gargammel/data/endo/GRCH38.genome.fa input`
`bwa index input`

Using the Burrows Wheeler aligner: 
1. Which algorithm should I use?
	- three algorithms, bwa mem, bwa sw and bwa backtrack
		- bwa mem is maximal exact matches for longer read lengths
		- bwa sw is for longer read lengths
		- bwa backtrack is meant for short Illumina reads up to 100bp
			- aln, samse and sampe are all extensions of backtrack
	- I previously used bwa backtrack by using bwa aln - this might be the best option for this task as well
