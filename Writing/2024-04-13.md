# Working on a bioinformatic USER treatment

- need to differentiate between partial and full USER (partial targets uracils in middle of fragment, full targets ones on the end)
- aDNA is often single-stranded on ends and the majority of deamination damage to unmethylated cytosines happens here
- When a uracil is excised from a single stranded region close to the end of the molecule 

Thinking about how to make this work...need a way to read the 5' and 3' misincorporation files, retrieve the position number for the line that has the frequency that drops below the threshold, then trim all the fq sequences that number of positions

Possibly simpler to do this with bash scripting...using awk? Then something like fqtools trim?

Trimmomatic? No...will only trim based on quality scores

Arguments to pass to script
- 5' misincorporation file
- 3' misincorporation file
- threshold (can I set a default?)

Can do this less elegantly using awk and fqtools..

To get the cutoff point from the misincorporation files: 

`awk -F' ' '$2<0.01{print$1}' 5pCtoT_freq.txt | head -1`
`awk -F' ' '$2<0.01{print$1}' 3pGtoA_freq.txt | head -1`

Then do: 

`conda activate fqtools-env`
`fqtools trim -o sim_data_s1_USER -s [LENGTH] [FILE]`

Have generated USER-treated files for s1 and s2! Need to confirm this worked as expected by generating another mapDamage plot
- first need to align sequences to generate BAM file

This is what I ran before to align the simulated sequences:
