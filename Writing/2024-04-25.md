Ran DamMet last night, success!!
However, only a fraction of CpGs actually were able to provide enough data to perform methylation estimation. Need to assess reasons why...
- coverage/depth? Either sites were not covered at all or not covered with enough depth

How can I find out stats on coverage and depth...

do 
`samtools stats in.bam`
`samtools coverage `
