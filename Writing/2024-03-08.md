## Running gargammel

- tried to activate conda env I used earlier by running:
`$ conda activate /home/sam/envs/gargammel`

but it didn't work, gave the error: not a conda environment

Just had the wrong path: should be /home/sam/miniconda3/envs/gargammel
- activated gargammel env
- cd'd into my files and the gargammel folder with the data I need

Missing: frequency distribution data...how to get this:
- [x] check github documentation for a preset file (similar to damage)
- [x] check literature?
- [ ] run a program (mapDamage????) to get representative info

Hmm... in the interest of time would it possibly be better to just pass gargammel a specific length? It is possible to just specify
`-l 45`
Or whatever length necessary. How would that change things downstream?
- I wouldn't get proper FLDs (since everything is the same length)
	- we would normally use FLDs to look at whether sequences are genuine or not, so may this isn't the biggest deal in this application
Decision: timing is an issue, this project needs to be finished by end of April and I'm still on the first step - let's go with the simpler option of a defined length

Which length to choose?
Ancient samples typically peak around 30s - defined length 35 bp

I did specify max-size, I probably don't need to after this - take this out of the code. 

Run #1: First real run!!!
