Working on: using gargammel to generate simulated ancient DNA fragments. Gargammel is working and I have used it to simulate fragments but I need to figure out the file for input to --matfilenonmeth 

From last time: 

Run #1: 
` $ gargammel -o results/ -n 1000000 --maxsize 100 --methyl -damage 0.024,0.36,0.0097,0.68 data`
` Error: Must define --matfilenonmeth if methylation is used`

From gargammel help: 
`-matfilenonmeth [matrix file prefix]    Read the matrix file of substitutions for non-methylated Cs Provide the prefix only, both files must end with5.dat and 3.dat`

What's needed: matrix file of substitutions for non-methylated Cs, provide prefix only, both files must end with 5.dat and 3.dat.

This option will indicate on the - strand where cytosines are methylated by using g and G variably. Do we need this? I think the whole point of this project is to show that we can identify methylated cytosines without knowing where they are prior - so maybe not useful right now

Run #2:
