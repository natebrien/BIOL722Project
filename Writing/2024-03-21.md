## More mapping with bwa
- use bwa aln to map simulated aDNA reads to human genome
- next steps: run mapDamage to generate 'smile' plots and verify that deamination damage has been added 

Use bwa aln/sampe
- differences?

Ran 
`bwa mem ref_db/ sim_read1 sim_read2 > sim_aln.sam`

Got the error: [E::bwa_idx_load_from_disk] fail to locate the index files
Troubleshooting on the internet...
Suggestions to run bwa mem in the same directory as the index files
Need to first generate links to the input read files in the directory with the reference and index files

`ln -s /home/natassja/scratch/Bio722/term_project/gargammel/quality_control/sim_data_s1_trimmed sim_read1`

`ln -s /home/natassja/scratch/Bio722/term_project/gargammel/quality_control/sim_data_s2_trimmed sim_read2
`

Try again in same directory: 
`bwa mem GRCh38.p14.genome.fa sim_read1 sim_read2 > sim_aln.sam`

Same error: no index files found. 
Tried using chmod to change permissions, no luck
