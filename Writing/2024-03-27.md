## Bwa - mem
- ran bwa mem on simulated reads, to produce sam file
- need to process sam file? How to input to Mapdamage?

## MapDamage

- mapDamage not on info2020 - check other nodes
- install using: 

`conda create -n mapdamage-env`

`conda install -c bioconda mapdamage2`

Tried to run mapDamage on simulated read alignment file (SAM)

`mapDamage -i sim_aln.sam -r GRCh38.p14.genome.fa`

Worked! Also, misincorporation plot (smile plot) looks exactly as it should
