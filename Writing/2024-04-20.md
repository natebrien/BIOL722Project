Tasks still to do for this project
- [ ] Run epiPaleomix (need to figure out one of the input files)
- [ ] Run DamMet (need to figure out the -chrom file)
- [ ] Troubleshoot bioinformatic USER treatment
	- [ ] Need to use bwa aln instead of bwa mem?

## Troubleshooting epiPaleomix

The story so far...
- installed dependencies (including older version of R)
- installed epipaleomix
- generated makefile template
- filled in paths to correct files in the makefile
- makefile did not work
- downloaded dry run files
- ran dry run successfully

...need to find out what's going on. Likely something in the makefile itself. Possibly accidentally threw off the YAML code somehow?
