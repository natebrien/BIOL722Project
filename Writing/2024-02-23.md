Working on: using gargammel to generate fragments with methylation and with deamination damage

Run #1: 
` $ gargammel -o results/ -n 1000000 --maxsize 100 --methyl -damage 0.024,0.36,0.0097,0.68 data`
` Error: Must define --matfilenonmeth if methylation is used`

From gargammel help: 
`-matfilenonmeth [matrix file prefix]    Read the matrix file of substitutions for non-methylated Cs Provide the prefix only, both files must end with5.dat and 3.dat`
